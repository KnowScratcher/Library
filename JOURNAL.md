# 2025 June 28th: Upgrade UI.

I switch the view to tailwind css, which allows me to make prettier pages.

I feel pretty good about this layout.

Also, I finished the query part.

# 2025 July 3rd: Finish the edit function.
I finished the edit function, it was some painful hours.

But it went smooth like butter so not really anything to complain.
